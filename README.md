# Video Game Prototyping With Unity - _2D Platformer_
***
For this prototype we'll be looking into how we can make a 2D platformer. We'll also be diving into making art tools
that we can use in the editor, how to use sprites, and animations.

>[!TIP]
> [Here, you can download the sprites](https://github.com/sidneychurch/Unity-VGP-2DPlatformer/raw/refs/heads/main/VGP-platformer-sprites.zip) that I use in the guide here in order to follow along.

>[!NOTE]
>These guides will increasingly become bullet-point action lists, with the expectation that you've completed the previous
>guides that explain how to complete the actions in more detail or have the required knowledge of Unity and C# to follow along.
